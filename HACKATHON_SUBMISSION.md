2. Browse available prediction events
3. Place bets (10 coins per bet) on YES/NO outcomes
4. AI automatically resolves events
5. Winners receive 20 coins payout

### Sample Events (2025 Focus)
- "Will Tesla stock reach $300 by end of 2025?"
- "Will Bitcoin reach $150,000 by end of 2025?"
- "Will there be a new iPhone model released in 2025?"
- "Will SpaceX successfully land humans on Mars in 2025?"

## 💡 Innovation Highlights

### Desirability

- **Mass Appeal**: Simple YES/NO betting appeals to broad audience
- **Trust Through AI**: Automated resolution eliminates human bias
- **Instant Gratification**: Fast resolution keeps users engaged

### Technical Complexity
- **Multi-Layer Architecture**: C++ smart contracts + TypeScript bridge + React frontend
- **AI Integration**: Real-time event resolution using advanced language models
- **State Management**: Complex betting state across multiple data structures
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks and comprehensive validation

### Qubic Advantages
- **High Performance**: Leverages Qubic's 55M+ TPS capability
- **Zero Fees**: Users don't pay transaction fees
- **Native C++**: Direct smart contract execution without VM overhead
- **AI-Ready**: Perfect platform for AI-enhanced applications

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Smart Contract Functions
```cpp
// Core Functions Implemented
PUBLIC(RegisterUser)     // User registration with starting balance
PUBLIC(CreateEvent)      // Admin event creation
PUBLIC(PlaceBet)         // User betting with balance validation
PUBLIC(ResolveEvent)     // AI-triggered event resolution
PUBLIC(GetBalance)       // Real-time balance queries
PUBLIC(GetEvents)        // Active events listing
```

### Data Structures
- **Users**: ID, username, balance, bet statistics
- **Events**: Title, description, timing, resolution status
- **Bets**: User predictions, amounts, processing status

### Integration Flow
1. Web frontend calls Express API
2. Express bridge translates to Qubic CLI commands
3. Smart contract processes logic and updates state
4. Results flow back to web interface
5. AI triggers automatic event resolution
